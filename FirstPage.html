        <h3>Orange Blues am I right?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Life is peeling me!</h3>
        <div>
            <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?</p>

        <h3>(Another Orange Pun With Samuel L. Jackson Ipsums)!</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. </p>

        <h2>Where the Colour Orange was Created(Fact): Ann Arbor(Hometown)</h2>
        <div>
            <p>If you like crashing your car into lightpoles to avoid running over jaywalkers then come on down to Ann Arbor! An overhyped college town! People love A2 for it's deadly winters. We have great education because the schools never believe in snow days. What are those? Hashbash is alright. And there's lot of traffic from Noon to midnight for no reason. Honestly, if you want a A+ A2 expierence go to Ypsilanti.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Focus (with Will Smith and Margot Robbie was pretty good)!</h2>
        <div>
            <p>My main focus is definitely the very Boot Camp that taught me how to mae this personal website! Cool people, fun times, and lot's a learning! My spare time belongs to friends, but when everyone is busy I like to play games and produce music.</p>
